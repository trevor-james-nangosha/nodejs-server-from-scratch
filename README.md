# NODEJS SERVER FROM SCRATCH

The goal is to make a simplistic functional web server from scratch using Nodejs.  
This we intend to do using the inbuilt http, net and stream APIs  
The goal is to have a better understanding of these core functionalities of Nodejs especially streams and buffers

To start the application, run `node server.js` from the terminal and then run a `curl` command from another terminal
or open a browser and make a request to your port of choice.  

Feel free to modify as you find fit. Hack away!!!!!!!
